# DIV1D Matlab Wrapper

This repository contains the functions to automatically run DIV1D from Matlab

Default inputs can be set in default\_input.m
*Note that physics\_parameters.f90 and numerics\_parameters also define default inputs
*This can also be used to configure settings for different devices (e.g TCV or MAST-U)

These inputs are written into ".txt" and possible ".dat" files with write\_input.m.

DIV1D if the input files are written in your directory run\_div1d_code.m should run DIV1D.
